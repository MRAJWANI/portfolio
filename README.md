## Summary
With 4 years of experience at a leading professional services firm working across various data and business analyst focused roles, I am deeply interested in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Having worked across a range of sectors, industries and scopes, I am keen to further grow my Data Science, Data Analytics and Business Analytics capabilities in challenging and rewarding roles. I bring a proven track record of managing, designing and implementing data-driven solutions across finance, analytics, and sustainability contexts displaying a strong understanding of data pipelines, proficiency in working with complex datasets, and a knack for identifying key insights and being able to convey complex information to stakeholders. I am excited about the prospect of using my analytical, teamwork, presentational, and technical skills in a role that promotes professional growth and opportunities for development.
