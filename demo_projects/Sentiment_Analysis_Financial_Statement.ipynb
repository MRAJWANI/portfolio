We have held \"return to office\" and \"extended working from home\" workshops to ensure their views are considered in our decision making. Most of our offices have now re-opened although social distancing/COVID secure measures means that there are limits on the number of people that can be accommodated and we continue to comply with government requirements. This means that most people will continue to work remotely to varying extents in the short term, and the firm has put in place a number of measures to support this.\\nTo date, a strong pre-COVID-19 pipeline has meant that the impact on our financial results has been limited and we have not had to make redundancies or furlough any of our people as a result of the pandemic.\\nDespite the challenging economic environment in the UK, the firm has achieved revenue growth of 5%, from Â£2,447m to Â£2,567m and net revenue increased by 6% from Â£2,058m to Â£2,183m.\\nThe statutory profit for the financial period increased from Â£505m in 2019 to Â£509m in 2020 whilst the corresponding average statutory profit per partner decreased from Â£719,000 to Â£709,000 in 2020.

EY has a longstanding culture of flexible working and, in March 2020, we were able to rapidly mobilise our 17,000 people in the UK to work from home. We have continued to closely follow government guidelines and, as restrictions begin to ease, our focus now is on maximising the benefits of in-person collaboration with flexible remote working.\\nThe experience of the pandemic has brought new perspectives to our people and our clients on how they manage their working lives. How EY uses offices in the future will change with a greater emphasis on collaboration rather than as a place for individual working. Offices are no longer expected to be the default location for work, but we will continue to value the benefits of in-person working for collaboration, relationship building, training and wellbeing. As a result, EY is transitioning to a hybrid working model in the UK, with the expectation that most of our people will normally spend at least two days a week working remotely with the remainder of their time spent working together in person at a client site or EY office.\\nDespite the challenging economic environment in the UK during the first half of the financial year, the firm has achieved revenue growth of 7.3%, increasing from Â£2,567m to Â£2,754m and net revenue increased by 8.7% from Â£2,183m to Â£2,373m.

            " 2022 EY has achieved revenue growth of 17%, increasing from Â£2,754m to Â£3,229m. The firm saw growth across all of its four service lines with the strongest being Consulting at 33%. This was followed by Taxation, Assurance and Strategy and Transactions which generated growth of 15%, 11%, and 10% respectively.\\nThis has been a record year of growth for the firm, driven by the long-term investments that have been made in people, technology, sustainability and audit quality, as well as strong client demand. The decisions made in recent years, whether that's continuing to recruit during the pandemic, or the significant financial investments in acquisitions and new technologies, have underpinned the extraordinary growth experienced this financial year.\\nWith companies facing a convergence of challenges, from climate change and the pandemic to economic uncertainty and shifting consumer habits, the firm is investing in the talent and skills and services needed to help clients transform, grow and build trust with their stakeholders. Over the last financial year alone the firm has recruited over 5,500 people across all parts of the business and appointed 120 new equity partners. We welcomed a record 1,473 students, with almost 40% based in regional offices outside of London, as the firm continues to invest in young talent to support its future growth. The firm has also expanded its range of services in areas including technology consultancy and sustainability through acquisitions and the launch of EY Carbon.\\nAcquisitions during the current and preceding period contributed revenue of Â£47m (2021: Â£28m). Proforma revenue for the firm for entities within the group before 4 July 2020 was Â£3,182m compared with pro forma revenue of Â£2,727m in the previous year. This represents underlying organic growth of 17%.\\nThe statutory profit for the financial period increased from Â£596m in 2021 to Â£693m in 2022 whilst the corresponding average statutory profit per partner increased from Â£838,000 to Â£878,000 in 2022. The distributable profit before tax for the financial period increased from Â£533m in 2021 to Â£634m in 2022 and the corresponding average distributable profit per partner increased from Â£749,000 to Â£803,000.\\nIn September 2022, the firm announced that the strategic review of its businesses has progressed, and that EY leaders have reached the decision to move forward with partner votes to separate into two organisations. One would be a global network of multidisciplinary member firms committed to assurance, tax and advisory services with all the capabilities required to deliver high-quality audits, serve the public interest and focus on the CFO agenda and sustainability; and the other would be a new global corporate entity comprising Consulting, Strategy and Transactions, the majority of Tax, and managed services.\\nAs partners prepare to vote on whether to separate into two businesses, the firm considers that it is well- positioned to approach this industry defining move. The creation of two strong, independent businesses would help EY to better meet the needs of clients; create compelling careers for EY people; and serve the public interest by providing greater choice in the market and a global response to regulatory concerns.\\n\\nOur Transparency Report (accessible on our website) describes our approach to risk management and internal control.
